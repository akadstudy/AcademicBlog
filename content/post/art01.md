# Commonly Used Commands

When navigating the computerâ€™s `file/folder` system, there are a handful of commands that will be used the most. We are going to go over some of the most key, essential ones:

## Return working directory name

* `pwd`

The pwd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to the standard output.

## Change directory

* `cd`

This stands for "change directory" or, in simpler terms, change which folder we are in.

## List directory contents

* `ls`

`ls` displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.

## Clear the terminal screen

* `clear`

clear clears your screen if this is possible.  It looks in the environment for the terminal type and then in the terminfo database to figure out  how to clear the screen.

## Make directories
  
* `mkdir`

The `mkdir` utility creates the directories named as operands.

## Open files and directories

* `open`

The open command opens a file (or a directory or URL), just as if you had double-clicked the file's icon.

## Get the history in the current terminal session

* `history`

Want to know all the commands that have been ran in the current terminal session? Run the command, history to see them.

## Concatenate and print files

* `cat`

The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.

## Practice, Practice, Practice!

The Terminal is something that takes time and practice. 

Definitely go play around with it, navigate through folders, create new ones, and open newly created files.
